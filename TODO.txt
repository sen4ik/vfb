- When verse is being added, verify if the verse already exists
- Figure our where does “Invalid character found in method name. HTTP method names must be tokens” comes from
- [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/log/letsencrypt/.certbot.lock' Either run as root, or set --config-dir, --work-dir, and --logs-dir to writeable paths.
- Confirmation token can be reused to set new password. Is this a problem? Should ii expire in 15 minutes?
